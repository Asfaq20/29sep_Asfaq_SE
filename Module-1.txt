QUESTION-1 :- Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing? 

ANS:- No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, but they are related.

An HTML tag is a piece of code that is used to define different elements within an HTML document. 
A tag consists of an opening angle bracket "<", the name of the tag, and a closing angle bracket ">". 
For example, the tag for a paragraph is "<p>" and the tag for a heading is "<h1>".

An HTML element is made up of the opening tag, the content within the tag, and the closing tag. 
For example, a paragraph element would be written as "<p> This is a paragraph.</p>". The opening tag "<p>" 
indicates the start of the paragraph, the content "This is a paragraph." is the text of the paragraph, 
and the closing tag "</p>" indicates the end of the paragraph.

In summary, HTML tags define the type of element, while HTML elements include both the opening and closing tags 
as well as any content between them.

QUESTION-2 :- What are tags and attributes in HTML? 

ANS:- In HTML, tags and attributes are used to define the structure and appearance of a webpage.

Tags are the basic building blocks of an HTML document. They are used to define the structure of the document, 
such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other elements. A tag is a piece of code that is used to define
 an element. It consists of an opening tag, the element content, and a closing tag. For example, the "p" tag is
 used to define a paragraph, and it is written as "<p>Paragraph text here</p>". In this example, "<p>" is the 
opening tag, "Paragraph text here" is the content, and "</p>" is the closing tag.

Attributes, on the other hand, are used to provide additional information about an HTML element. They are used to 
modify the behavior or appearance of an element. Attributes are defined within the opening tag of an element, 
and they consist of a name and a value separated by an equals sign. For example, the "href" attribute is used 
to define the URL of a link, and it is written as "<a href="https://www.example.com">Link text here</a>". 
In this example, "href" is the attribute name, and "https://www.example.com" is the attribute value.

In summary, tags define the structure and type of an HTML element, while attributes provide additional information 
about an element to modify its behavior or appearance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-3 :- What are void elements in HTML? 

ANS:-In HTML, a void element is an element that has no content or closing tag. Void elements are self-closing, 
meaning they are written with only a single tag that ends with a forward slash "/>". Void elements are used to 
insert non-text content into an HTML document, such as images, line breaks, and input fields.

Examples of void elements in HTML include:
  -> <img> for inserting images
  -> <br> for inserting line breaks
  -> <input> for creating input fields
  -> <meta> for defining metadata about a webpage
  -> <link> for linking to external resources like stylesheets and scripts

Void elements do not have any content that goes between an opening and closing tag, and they do not have a closing 
tag. They are self-contained and do not need any additional markup to function properly. However, some older 
versions of HTML may require a trailing slash after the opening tag to indicate that it is a self-closing void 
element, such as "<img src="example.jpg"/>".

It is important to note that not all elements in HTML can be void elements. For example, a paragraph <p> element 
cannot be a void element because it requires content between its opening and closing tags.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-4 :-What are HTML Entities?

ANS:- HTML entities are special codes that are used to represent characters that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard or that 
have special meanings in HTML markup. For example, characters like < and > have special meanings in HTML, and using them 
directly in the text of a webpage can cause errors or unexpected behavior. HTML entities allow you to include these characters
 in your HTML markup without causing problems.

HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a specific code and a semicolon (;). For example, < is the HTML 
entity for the less-than symbol (<), and > is the HTML entity for the greater-than symbol (>). Some other common HTML entities 
include:

  -> & for the ampersand symbol (&)
  -> " for the double quote (")
  -> ' for the single quote (')
  -> for a non-breaking space

HTML entities are also used to represent special characters that are not commonly found on a keyboard, such as foreign letters, 
mathematical symbols, and currency symbols. For example, € is the HTML entity for the Euro symbol (€), and © is the HTML entity 
for the copyright symbol (©).

Using HTML entities is important to ensure that your web pages are displayed correctly across different browsers and devices. 
They provide a standardized way to represent characters that might otherwise cause errors or inconsistencies in your markup.

QUESTION-5 :-What are different types of lists in HTML? • What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?

ANS:-  1. Types of Lists in HTML:
HTML provides three different types of lists:
Ordered lists: Also known as numbered lists, they are used to display a list of items in a sequential order. They are created 
using the <ol> tag, and each item is marked with the <li> tag. Example:

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>

Unordered lists: Also known as bulleted lists, they are used to display a list of items in no particular order. They are created 
using the <ul> tag, and each item is marked with the <li> tag. Example:

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>

Definition lists: They are used to display a list of terms and their corresponding definitions. They are created using the <dl> tag,
 and each term and its definition are marked with the <dt> and <dd> tags, respectively. Example:

<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Definition 1</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>Definition 2</dd>
  <dt>Term 3</dt>
  <dd>Definition 3</dd>
</dl>

 2. The ‘class’ attribute in HTML:
The "class" attribute is used to assign a class or a group to an HTML element. Classes are used to define styles, layout, and other 
characteristics for a group of elements on a web page. A class attribute is defined within the opening tag of an HTML element using 
the syntax class="classname". The classname can be any name that is descriptive of the group of elements that it represents, such 
as "header", "footer", "navigation", or "highlight".

Multiple classes can be assigned to an element by separating the class names with a space. For example, <div class="container 
col-lg-6"> assigns both the "container" and "col-lg-6" classes to a div element. CSS can then be used to define the styles and 
layout for the elements with these class names.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-6 :-What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTMLelements?

ANS:- The 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute in HTML are both used to uniquely identify HTML elements, but they have some 
important differences.

The 'id' attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element on a web page. The 'id' attribute value should be unique 
across the entire web page, and it is often used to identify elements that need to be targeted by JavaScript or CSS. An 'id' 
attribute is defined within the opening tag of an HTML element using the syntax id="elementID". For example, <div id="header"> 
defines a div element with an 'id' attribute value of "header".

On the other hand, the 'class' attribute is used to identify a group of HTML elements that share common characteristics or styles. 
Multiple HTML elements can have the same 'class' attribute value, and a single HTML element can have multiple 'class' attribute 
values separated by spaces. A 'class' attribute is defined within the opening tag of an HTML element using the syntax class="classname". 
For example, <div class="container"> defines a div element with a 'class' attribute value of "container".

In summary, the main difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute in HTML is that the 'id' attribute is used to 
uniquely identify a single element, while the 'class' attribute is used to group multiple elements together based on common 
characteristics. The 'id' attribute should be used sparingly, as duplicate IDs on the same page can cause conflicts and errors, 
while the 'class' attribute can be used more liberally to apply styles and functionality to groups of related elements.

QUESTION-7 :-What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

ANS:- HTML provides a number of formatting tags that allow you to add visual styles and structure to your web page content. Here are 
some of the commonly used formatting tags in HTML:
 
  1.<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> - These tags are used to create headings with different levels of importance, from the most 
    important (h1) to the least important (h6).

  2.<p> - This tag is used to create paragraphs of text.
 
  3.<br> - This tag is used to insert a line break (i.e., a new line) in the middle of a paragraph.

  4.<hr> - This tag is used to create a horizontal rule (a line) to separate sections of a page.

  5.<em> - This tag is used to italicize text.

  6.<strong> - This tag is used to bold text.

  7.<u> - This tag is used to underline text.

  8.<strike> - This tag is used to strike through text.

  9.<sup> - This tag is used to create superscript text (text that is raised above the normal line of text).

  10.<sub> - This tag is used to create subscript text (text that is lowered below the normal line of text).

  11.<blockquote> - This tag is used to create a blockquote (a long quotation or excerpt from a text).

  12.<code> - This tag is used to create inline code snippets.

These are just a few of the formatting tags available in HTML. There are many others that can be used to add structure and style to 
your web page content. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-8 :-How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?

ANS:-  Cell padding and cell spacing are two attributes used in HTML table elements to control the amount of space between cells 
and the contents of cells.

Cell padding refers to the space between the content of a cell and its border. When you add padding to a cell, you are essentially
 adding extra space between the content of the cell and its border. You can set the amount of padding using the cellpadding attribute
 in the table tag.

Cell spacing, on the other hand, refers to the space between the borders of adjacent cells. When you add spacing to a table, you are
 creating additional space between the borders of adjacent cells, making the table easier to read and more visually appealing. 
You can set the amount of spacing using the cellspacing attribute in the table tag.

To summarize, cell padding controls the space between the content of a cell and its border, while cell spacing controls the space 
between the borders of adjacent cells. Both attributes are used to control the appearance and readability of tables on a web page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-9 :-How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?

ANS:- In HTML tables, you can merge two or more rows or columns into a single row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

To merge two or more rows into a single row, you can use the rowspan attribute in the cell that you want to span across multiple rows. 
The value of the rowspan attribute should be set to the number of rows that you want to span. For example, if you want to merge three 
rows into a single row, you can use the following code:

<tr>
  <td rowspan="3">This cell spans 3 rows</td>
  <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Row 3, Column 2</td>
</tr>

To merge two or more columns into a single column, you can use the colspan attribute in the cell that you want to span across 
multiple columns. The value of the colspan attribute should be set to the number of columns that you want to span. For example, 
if you want to merge two columns into a single column, you can use the following code:

<tr>
  <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
  <td colspan="2">This cell spans 2 columns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
  <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
  <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
</tr>

In the above example, the cell with the colspan attribute will span across two columns, merging them into a single column.

By using the rowspan and colspan attributes in your HTML table, you can create more complex and visually appealing table layouts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-10 :-What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element? 

ANS:- In HTML, block-level elements and inline elements are two different types of elements that are used to structure and format 
the content of a web page.

Block-level elements are elements that take up the full width of their parent container and create a new line before and after the 
element. Some common examples of block-level elements include headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul>, <ol>), 
and divs (<div>). Block-level elements are typically used to create the main structure of a web page.

Inline elements, on the other hand, are elements that only take up as much width as necessary to display their content, and do not 
create a new line before or after the element. Some common examples of inline elements include links (<a>), images (<img>), and spans
 (<span>). Inline elements are typically used to format or style text within a block-level element.

The main differences between block-level elements and inline elements are:

  -> Block-level elements take up the full width of their parent container, while inline elements only take up as much width 
     as necessary.
  -> Block-level elements create a new line before and after the element, while inline elements do not.
  -> Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline elements, while inline elements can only contain other inline 
     elements.

Understanding the difference between block-level and inline elements is important for creating well-structured and visually 
appealing web pages. By using the appropriate elements for the content you are creating, you can ensure that your web page is easy 
to read, navigate, and understand.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-11 :-How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? 

ANS:- To create a hyperlink in HTML, you can use the <a> tag. The <a> tag is used to define a hyperlink and contains an attribute 
called href, which specifies the destination URL of the hyperlink. Here's an example of how to create a basic hyperlink:

<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>

In the above example, the href attribute is set to "https://www.example.com", which is the destination URL of the hyperlink. 
The text "Click here to visit Example.com" is the visible text of the hyperlink, which the user clicks on to navigate to the 
destination URL.

You can also create a hyperlink that links to another page on your own website by using a relative URL. For example:

<a href="about.html">About Us</a>

In this example, the href attribute is set to "about.html", which is a relative URL that links to a page called "about.html" in 
the same directory as the current page.

Additionally, you can add additional attributes to the <a> tag to style the appearance of the hyperlink or add additional 
functionality, such as the target attribute to specify whether the link should open in a new window or tab. Here's an example:

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to visit Example.com</a>

In this example, the target attribute is set to "_blank", which opens the destination URL in a new window or tab. The rel attribute 
is also included with the values "noopener noreferrer" to prevent potential security vulnerabilities associated with opening links 
in a new window or tab.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-12 :-What is the use of an iframe tag?

ANS:- The <iframe> tag in HTML is used to embed a separate HTML document within the current document. It allows you to display 
content from another source or website within your own web page.

The src attribute is used to specify the URL of the document that you want to embed within the <iframe> element. Here's an example:

<iframe src="https://www.example.com"></iframe>
In this example, the <iframe> element embeds the content of the URL "https://www.example.com" within the current document. This can 
be useful for displaying content such as maps, videos, or social media feeds from another website.

You can also specify other attributes to customize the appearance and behavior of the <iframe> element, such as width, height, 
scrolling, and frameborder. Here's an example:

<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>

In this example, the <iframe> element has a width of 500 pixels and a height of 400 pixels. The scrolling attribute is set to "no" 
to disable scrollbars within the embedded content. The frameborder attribute is set to "0" to remove the border around the <iframe> 
element.

It's important to note that embedding content from other websites within your own website can have potential security risks, as it 
can allow malicious content to be displayed within your web page. Therefore, it's recommended to only embed content from trusted 
sources, and to ensure that the <iframe> element is secure and properly configured.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-13 :-What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

ANS:- The <span> tag in HTML is used to group inline elements and apply styles to them, without affecting the layout or structure of the 
document. It's typically used to apply styles such as color, font size, or text decoration to specific sections of text within a larger block 
of content.

Here's an example of how to use the <span> tag:

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <span style="color: red;">consectetur adipiscing elit</span>, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore 
et dolore magna aliqua.</p>

In this example, the <span> tag is used to apply the color: red; style to the text "consectetur adipiscing elit". The <span> element does 
not add any additional layout or structure to the document, but simply applies the specified style to the enclosed text.

You can also use CSS to apply styles to <span> elements by defining a class or ID and targeting it with a CSS rule. Here's an example:

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <span class="highlight">consectetur adipiscing elit</span>, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et 
dolore magna aliqua.</p>

<style>
    .highlight {
        color: red;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
</style>

In this example, the <span> element is assigned a highlight class, which is targeted by the CSS rule to apply the color: red; and font-weight: 
bold; styles to the enclosed text. This allows you to apply consistent styles to multiple <span> elements throughout your document, without 
having to repeat the same inline styles for each one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-14 :-How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?

ANS:- To insert a picture into a background image of a web page, you can use CSS to apply the background image and then use the HTML <img> 
tag to insert the picture. Here's an example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Background Image with Picture</title>
	<style>
		body {
			background-image: url('background-image.jpg');
			background-repeat: no-repeat;
			background-size: cover;
			background-position: center;
		}
		
		img {
			position: absolute;
			top: 50%;
			left: 50%;
			transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
			max-width: 80%;
			max-height: 80%;
			border-radius: 50%;
			box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<img src="picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
</body>
</html>

In this example, the CSS background-image property is used to apply the background image to the body element of the document. 
The background-repeat, background-size, and background-position properties are also used to control the appearance of the background image.

The <img> tag is then used to insert the picture into the document. The CSS position, top, left, transform, max-width, max-height, 
border-radius, and box-shadow properties are used to position and style the picture within the background image.

Note that the picture is inserted as an independent element within the document, and is not actually inserted into the background image itself. 
The CSS properties are used to position the picture over the background image to create the illusion that the picture is part of the background.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-15 :-How are active links different from normal links? 

ANS:- Active links and normal links are two different states of a hyperlink in HTML.

A normal link is a hyperlink that has not been interacted with by the user. It is usually displayed as underlined text in a different color 
than the surrounding text. When the user clicks on the link, it becomes an active link.

An active link is a hyperlink that has been interacted with by the user. It is usually displayed as underlined text in a different color or 
with a different background color than the surrounding text. This helps the user to understand which links they have already clicked on.

In addition, a visited link is a hyperlink that the user has previously clicked on. By default, visited links are displayed in a different 
color than normal links and active links, to indicate that they have already been visited.

To define the appearance of normal, active, and visited links in HTML, you can use the following CSS pseudo-classes:

  :link - defines the style of unvisited links
  :visited - defines the style of visited links
  :hover - defines the style of links when the user hovers over them
  :active - defines the style of links when the user clicks on them
Here's an example of how to define the styles of normal, active, and visited links:

  a:link {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
  }

  a:visited {
  color: purple;
  text-decoration: underline;
  }

  a:hover {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: none;
  }

  a:active {
  color: green;
  text-decoration: underline;
  }

In this example, unvisited links are displayed in blue with an underline, visited links are displayed in purple with an underline, hovered links 
are displayed in red without an underline, and active links are displayed in green with an underline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-16 :- What are the different tags to separate sections of text? 

ANS:- In HTML, there are several tags that can be used to separate sections of text:

 1.<p> tag: The <p> tag is used to define paragraphs of text. It is typically used to group together several sentences or a single block of text.

 2.<h1> to <h6> tags: The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define headings of different levels. They are typically used to indicate the structure
   of the document, with <h1> being the main heading and the other levels being subheadings.

 3.<div> tag: The <div> tag is used to define a division or section of a document. It is typically used to group together related elements or 
   to create a layout structure.

 4.<section> tag: The <section> tag is used to define a section of a document that is self-contained and can be understood on its own. It is 
   typically used to group together related content.

 5.<article> tag: The <article> tag is used to define a complete, independent, and self-contained piece of content. It is typically used to 
   represent blog posts, news articles, or other similar content.

 6.<aside> tag: The <aside> tag is used to define content that is related to the main content of the page but is not an integral part of it. 
   It is typically used to represent sidebars, notes, or other similar content.

 7.<blockquote> tag: The <blockquote> tag is used to define a section of quoted text. It is typically used to represent quotes from other 
   sources, such as books or articles.

These tags can be used in combination with each other to create a well-structured document with clearly defined sections of text.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-17 :-What is SVG? 

ANS:-SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a file format for 2D graphics that uses XML to define the graphics elements. SVG files 
can be created with text editors or drawing software and are typically used for web graphics, icons, logos, and illustrations.

Unlike raster graphics formats such as JPEG and PNG, which use a grid of pixels to represent images, SVG graphics are defined by mathematical 
equations that describe the shapes, lines, and colors of the image. This means that SVG graphics can be scaled up or down without losing 
quality, and can be edited with ease.

SVG files can be embedded directly into HTML documents using the <svg> tag, or referenced as external files using the <img> tag. They can be 
styled with CSS, animated with JavaScript, and are compatible with most modern web browsers.

Some of the benefits of using SVG graphics include:

 ->They are resolution-independent, so they look sharp on any screen size or resolution.
 ->They can be animated and interactive, making them suitable for creating web animations and user interfaces.
 ->They are lightweight and have small file sizes, which helps improve website performance and load times.
 ->They can be easily edited and customized with text editors or drawing software.

Overall, SVG is a powerful and versatile file format for creating high-quality 2D graphics for the web.

QUESTION-18 :-What is difference between HTML and XHTML? 

ANS:- HTML and XHTML are two different markup languages used to create web pages. The main differences between the two are:

  1.Syntax: HTML uses a more lenient syntax, while XHTML has a stricter syntax that follows the rules of XML. In XHTML, all elements and 
    attributes must be properly nested and closed, and all tags must be in lowercase.

  2.Doctype declaration: HTML has several different doctype declarations, while XHTML has only one. The doctype declaration tells the browser 
    which version of HTML or XHTML is being used, and affects how the browser parses the page.

  3.Self-closing tags: In HTML, some elements can be self-closing, while in XHTML, all elements must be closed with a closing tag or a 
    self-closing tag.

  4.Quoting attribute values: In HTML, attribute values can be quoted with either single or double quotes, while in XHTML, they must be quoted 
    with double quotes.

  5.Error handling: In HTML, the browser can often parse and display a page even if there are errors in the code, while in XHTML, even minor 
    errors can cause the page to fail to display.

Overall, XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML that follows the rules of XML. It was introduced to help create more 
interoperable and well-formed web pages. However, HTML is still widely used and remains the most common markup language for creating web pages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION-19 :-What are logical and physical tags in HTML? 

ANS:- In HTML, logical tags refer to the semantic or meaning-based tags that describe the purpose of the content they contain. Physical tags, 
on the other hand, describe the visual appearance or presentation of the content.

Logical tags include tags like <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <ul> and <ol> for lists, and <table> for tables. These tags describe 
the meaning or purpose of the content they contain, which can be helpful for search engines, screen readers, and other assistive technologies.

Physical tags include tags like <font>, <center>, and <b> for changing the font size, color, alignment, and boldness of text. These tags 
describe the visual appearance of the content, but do not provide any information about the meaning or purpose of the content.

In general, it is recommended to use logical tags whenever possible, as they help create more accessible, semantic, and well-structured web 
pages. Physical tags, on the other hand, are generally considered outdated and are not recommended for use in modern HTML documents.
